I'll create 4 classes 1 abstract class 3 inheritative classes
teacher,student,employee
I'll make uploading/exporting txt file
Probably I'll export txt file into db

There'll be a sidebar with 3 options which will make user able
to switch between app views

---------- Main view ---------------------
It'll be divided into 2 sections

data section and form section

---------- Upload view -------------------
I think that there'll be a simple form

---------- Options view ------------------
I'll think about it later
